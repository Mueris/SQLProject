# SQLProject
Hi, This project had given for a course of mine, DATA Management. In this project we were expected to develope a program which behaves like a SQL Database and listenes the commands and returns the true informations.
Also we wrote the new datas to a json file so we could manage the database.

This project had some requriments, you can check them from the project pdf. This requriments was for to be sure that we were capable of doing the tasks without libraries.
We were allowed to use the "pandas" library for sort and we had used it. But expcept sorting, we were expected to use our own methods hence, you can see that some problems could be solved easly, but it couldnt. 
It is because of requriments of the proejct.
